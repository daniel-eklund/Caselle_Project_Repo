# Caselle_Project_Repo
This was an interview project done for Caselle

# Triangle solver #
Made with wpf and c# through visual studio 2019
I wanted to ensure all the ui elements used data bindings
from my ViewModel, this ensures that we are allowing
ourselves to reuse code without having to do strict 
bindings everytime we add a new shape to our ui.
With that being said, I am sure adding a different
type such as a square would be trivial, and adding
more traingles would be as simple as editing our xaml
(i.e copying and pasting existing xaml).

# Things still to do # 
The best part of any project is noticing all the little
things that you would want to add or impliment.<br>
-Canvas component:<br>
Drawing the shape dynamically via lines binded to our data<br>
-More shapes:<br>
Adding shapes should be easy, would be fun as a proof of concept
